[CPU]
CLD NB: The state of the decimal flag is uncertain when the CPU is powered up and it is not reset when an interrupt is generated. In both cases you should include an explicit CLD to ensure that the flag is cleared before performing addition or subtraction.

JMP NB

+ Stack initial state: why is it 0xFD when, according to nes dev wiki, stack always uses some of addresses from 0x100-0x1FF?

[PPU]
+ MIRRORING
PPUSTATUS($2002) register - should I initialize it with zero, or some other value?
+ PPUDATA read (post-fetch) - (read "The PPUDATA read buffer (post-fetch)" section at "http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_registers") - should ppu store an internal vram buffer?
+ render enable
render enable leftmost
+ Palette bytes mirroring
Pixel evaluation, clear OAM - return 0xff during clearing when reading 0x2004
+ 8x16 sprites - sprite evaluation
first empty sprite - y coord of 63 sprite, than sequential 0xff
+ In what cycles pixels are drawn?
+ Reading PPUDATA during vblank is ok, but what about rendering enable/disable??? SHould it be only vblank where it is ok to read?
Write to OAMDMA during rendering. Is it ok?
!!!Write to PPUDATA during rendering - is it ok? Donkey Kong won't display the monkey without it!!!


[BUGS]
+ Instruction - unnecessary read operations can have influence on some registers(0x2002 bit 7, for example)
